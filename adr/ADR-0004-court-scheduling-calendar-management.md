# ADR-0001: Court Scheduling and Calendar Management Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The JMS system requires a comprehensive court scheduling and calendar management system to handle scheduling for 60 locations across a calendar/fiscal year. Current requirements include:
- Managing dates as available/unavailable per location
- Exception date management for holidays and closures
- Override functionality for emergency summoning
- Schedule change tracking with audit trail
- Bulk schedule updates across multiple locations

The system must integrate with existing tenant isolation patterns, authentication/authorization framework, and maintain consistency with other JMS services.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-phase court scheduling system using a dedicated schema with row-level security, RESTful APIs, and comprehensive audit logging. The architecture will consist of:

1. **Dedicated Database Schema** (`jms.court_scheduling`) with RLS policies for tenant isolation
2. **RESTful API** with granular permission-based authorization
3. **Exception and Override System** with approval workflows
4. **Bulk Operation Support** with transactional consistency
5. **Comprehensive Audit Trail** with 7-year retention policy

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: System can efficiently handle 60 locations Ã— 365 days per year
- **Flexibility**: Exception and override system supports complex business rules and emergency scenarios
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail ensures compliance and traceability
- **Performance**: Bulk operations and caching strategies ensure acceptable response times
- **Consistency**: Follows established JMS patterns for tenant isolation and security

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multi-phase implementation requires careful coordination across teams
- **Storage Requirements**: Audit trail will consume significant database storage over time
- **Learning Curve**: Development team needs to understand workflow patterns and approval processes
- **Testing Effort**: Comprehensive testing required for all exception scenarios and bulk operations

### Neutral
- **Integration Dependencies**: Requires coordination with Auth Service, Tenant Service, and Notification Service
- **Migration Path**: Existing scheduling data (if any) will need migration strategy
- **Performance Monitoring**: Will require new monitoring dashboards and alerts

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single-table design without dedicated schema**
   - Rejected: Would complicate tenant isolation and reduce query performance
   
2. **Event-sourcing architecture**
   - Rejected: Over-engineered for current requirements, would increase complexity
   
3. **NoSQL document store for schedule data**
   - Rejected: Loses transactional consistency and complicates reporting

4. **Synchronous audit logging**
   - Rejected: Would impact write performance, async processing preferred

## Notes
### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Data model and repository layer (2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Calendar management API (1-2 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Exception handling and overrides (2 weeks)
4. **Phase 4**: Bulk operations and audit trail (1-2 weeks)

### Key Technical Decisions
- Use PostgreSQL RLS for tenant isolation consistency
- Implement EF Core interceptors for automatic audit logging
- Use in-memory caching for frequently accessed location data
- Async processing for bulk operations over 1000 records

### Security Considerations
- All operations require JWT authentication
- Granular permissions for different scheduling operations
- Emergency override requires special approval permissions
- Audit trail includes user identification and IP address
