# ADR-0001: Use Architectural Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The JMS project involves multiple teams, complex architectural decisions, and long-term maintenance considerations. We need a way to:
- Document important architectural decisions
- Understand the reasoning behind past decisions
- Share knowledge across teams
- Onboard new team members effectively
- Track the evolution of our architecture

Without proper documentation, we risk:
- Repeating past mistakes
- Making contradictory decisions
- Losing context when team members leave
- Difficulty in understanding why certain approaches were chosen

## Decision
We will use Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions in the JMS project. ADRs will be:
- Stored in a dedicated repository (jms-adr-docs)
- Written in Markdown format
- Numbered sequentially (ADR-XXXX)
- Reviewed through pull requests
- Referenced in code and other documentation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context preserved for future reference
- Improved knowledge sharing across teams
- Better onboarding for new team members
- Traceable decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional overhead in decision-making process
- Requires discipline to maintain
- May slow down initial implementation

### Neutral
- Becomes part of the development workflow
- Requires team training on ADR format

## Alternatives Considered
- **Wiki documentation**: Rejected because wikis tend to become outdated and lack version control
- **Code comments only**: Rejected because they don't capture the full context and alternatives
- **Meeting notes**: Rejected because they're not easily discoverable or structured

## Notes
This is the first ADR and establishes the practice of using ADRs in the JMS project.
