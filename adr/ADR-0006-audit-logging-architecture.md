# ADR-0006: Comprehensive Audit Logging Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The JMS system requires comprehensive audit logging to meet compliance requirements, support troubleshooting, and enable security monitoring. We need to track all data changes, user actions, and system events across all microservices while maintaining performance and reliability.

Key requirements:
- Complete audit trail of all data modifications
- User action tracking with context
- Compliance report generation
- Minimal performance impact
- High reliability (no audit data loss)
- Future analytics capabilities
- Multi-tenant isolation

## Decision
Implement a hybrid audit logging architecture combining local storage for immediate consistency with event-driven publishing for analytics and future centralization. Core audit infrastructure will be built in jms-common library and integrated into each service.

Architecture components:
1. **Shared Library (jms-common)**: Core audit interfaces, EF Core interceptors, and event schemas
2. **Local Storage**: Each service stores audit data locally in dedicated schema
3. **Event Publishing**: Asynchronous publishing to message queue for analytics
4. **Future Audit Service**: Path to centralized audit service when scale demands

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero Data Loss**: Local storage ensures audit data is never lost due to network issues
- **Performance**: Async event publishing doesn't impact main transaction performance
- **Consistency**: Audit data is immediately queryable within each service
- **Flexibility**: Can evolve to centralized model without breaking changes
- **Reusability**: Common library ensures consistent implementation across services

### Negative
- **Storage Overhead**: Each service needs audit table management and partitioning
- **Query Complexity**: Cross-service audit queries require aggregation
- **Operational Overhead**: More tables to manage and monitor
- **Initial Development**: Significant upfront investment in infrastructure

### Neutral
- **Event Delivery**: Eventually consistent for analytics use cases
- **Storage Growth**: Requires partition management strategy
- **Migration Path**: Clear path to centralized service when needed

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Immediate Centralized Audit Service**
   - Rejected: Adds distributed transaction complexity too early
   - Network dependency could cause audit data loss
   - Single point of failure for all services

2. **Local Storage Only (No Events)**
   - Rejected: No path to analytics or centralization
   - Difficult to correlate events across services
   - Limited compliance reporting capabilities

3. **Event-Only Architecture**
   - Rejected: Risk of data loss if queue fails
   - No immediate query capability
   - Complex to ensure exactly-once delivery

4. **Direct Database Writes to Central DB**
   - Rejected: Tight coupling between services
   - Performance bottleneck
   - Complex connection management

## Notes

### Implementation Strategy
1. Build core library with interfaces and interceptors
2. Implement local storage with monthly partitioning
3. Add event publishing with retry logic
4. Integrate into services incrementally
5. Monitor and optimize based on usage

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive data classification and filtering
- Audit log immutability
- Encryption for PII data
- Access control on audit queries
- Tamper detection mechanisms

### Performance Targets
- < 5ms overhead per transaction
- < 1 minute event publishing latency
- Query response < 500ms for 1M records
- 99.9% event delivery success rate

### Future Evolution
When scale demands centralization:
1. Deploy central audit service
2. Services continue local writes
3. Dual-write to central service
4. Migrate queries to central service
5. Phase out local storage

### Compliance Mappings
- **GDPR Article 30**: Processing activity records
- **HIPAA ยง 164.312(b)**: Audit controls
- **SOC 2 CC6.1**: Logical access controls
- **PCI DSS 10.2**: Actions to be logged
